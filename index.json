Previous failures at launching a music recommendation startup at 18 years old have been demotivational, but my efforts were what caused me to be headhunted for Hatless. 2023 marks the beginning of a new chapter, as university has been completed, my time and energy are unshackled\u0026lt;sub\u0026gt;[[1]](/blogs/whoami/)\u0026lt;/sub\u0026gt;. + + I studied at the [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/). My undergraduate dissertation was a machine learning music recommendation SAAS web app that recommended familiar and novel music based on the mood someone\u0026#39;s looking for, and their emotional profile. It has a single source of truth integration with Spotify. It used reinforcement learning from user ratings to improve its music-emotion model. I\u0026rsquo;m Jordan, a 22 year old software engineer who is fresh out of university as of last year. I work as an Android Engineer at Realwear Inc.. It\u0026rsquo;s been an incredibly educational experience. But my whole journey learning up here has just been crazy. I\u0026rsquo;ve somehow been all over the shop, I mean, I started out in full stack development, not Android.\n\u0026hellip;Yeah, working on database models, all the way up to frontends that deal with plenty of user data, roles and permissions, and integrations with third-party APIs. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t just start off in one area apparently. But this was only because I needed to do it. I was passionate about one project: Emotion. A desktop app that integrated with Spotify and lets you rate how songs made you feel. This let you instantly create playlists for the mood you\u0026rsquo;re looking for. And of course, at first it didn\u0026rsquo;t need a database. But then I needed cloud synchronisation across my desktop and mobile devices. User analytics data for the upcoming beta test. etc. You get the picture.\nAnd there I went, in vanilla PHP I made a backend and a database in phpMyAdmin, with the little authentication knowledge I knew from Computer Science A Level. And it was exhilarating to see this all work. I felt just incredible.\n\u0026hellip;Before I released the beta and 95% of users stopped using it after 5 minutes. The remaining? After about 1 hour.\nTo say this put me off working on personal projects is an understatement, and it feels like much of the last 4 years of my life have been trying to coax blood out of stone, inspiring me to actually finish that project. And this site is a step in that direction. But I\u0026rsquo;m a little too harsh on myself. I created that desktop app in Windows Forms (a Windows exclusive technology\u0026hellip; yuck\u0026hellip;) when I was just 18 years old.\nBecause of that, I was headhunted by a group of students making a software contracting firm. I worked as a full stack developer and delivered some brilliant work at breakneck speed, and led projects which reversed death marches and found us with plenty of success.\nBut something else called for me. One of our clients asked me specifically to join their team, and I did. In Unity development. SimplyVideo had me developing VR meeting room software that integrated with Pexip. I accomplished that, and led another team and did more, which I can\u0026rsquo;t say under NDA because it unfortunately was never released. And it\u0026rsquo;s a shame because it is some seriously amazing integrations, that we will inevitably see in the future, it\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of time. It just won\u0026rsquo;t be me who does it.\nDue to conflict between cofounders, that startup collapsed. I soon found myself in the arms of a much bigger company, the largest company I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been in. RealWear. In Android.\nAnd I haven\u0026rsquo;t mentioned yet that my undergrad dissertation was a machine learning web app SAAS platform that was a massively improved Emotion? Using the skills I built in that contracting firm?\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s a bit ridiculous when I say it, but I\u0026rsquo;ve genuinely touched almost every area of software engineering, even going down (briefly) to the C++ layer for the purposes of WebRTC technologies.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t to say I don\u0026rsquo;t have a shit load to learn. I do. But it\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;m really proud about. However, these days, I care more about actually shipping something. It has been mostly out of my hands what the last 4 years have seen me accomplish, with the great overhead pressure of university constantly at my back. But 2023 is the first year where I have been unshackled, and now there\u0026rsquo;s no telling what could happen.\n","date":"21 January 2023","permalink":"/blogs/whoami/","section":"Blogs","summary":"# /docs/jordan-peters-aka-rollersteaam + I\u0026#39;m a 22 year old software engineer who works for [Realwear Inc.](https://www.realwear.com/) as an Android Engineer\u0026lt;sub\u0026gt;[[1]](/blogs/whoami/)\u0026lt;/sub\u0026gt;, and I\u0026#39;m fanatically passionate about technology, software, creativity, UI/UX, design, productivity and psychology.","title":"whoami"},{"content":"Why does this exist?\u003e Why does this exist? # My thoughts needed a place that wasn\u0026rsquo;t locked inside my Notion.\nOther people have been braver than me and shared their thoughts bare for eyes to see, without any hubris. A blog doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist to save the world or fix a grand problem. Especially not in one blog post. But it does inspire people, who eventually succeed at that.\nEvery fragment of information counts, and when you write, you convert the billions of bits of information you encounter every day into solid nodes that you can network and revelate into future actions.\nSo what is this place?\u003e So what is this place? # I came up with an idea.\nScientific papers are beautiful, but incredibly daunting to the layman. There is likely some academic snobbery and classism to explain that. But this beauty lies in its structure - they are actually designed for very concise reportings of progress, which is the exact opposite of your initial impression to them.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re a weird mixture of docs and blogs. Docs, the life blood of software, are a quick reference to learn a concept validated prior by engineers and their many works before it, where as a result you can immediately apply it. Blogs are the recorded paths, golden and muddy, to act as warning signs for other adventurers, and signs of hope.\nBlogs inform the docs. This website is designed around combining them both to lace the loose strands of knowledge together completely: a doc concisely explains the concept as objective as it can be explained. Blogs are every step to achieving that understanding. You will see references to blogs (hopefully) after most sentences in a doc, to explain how I\u0026rsquo;ve reached such a conclusion.\nThe result? I can construct a handbook of easily communicable skills that you can pick up. And you can also create jumps in your own understanding, likely above mine, by diving deeper into my blogs and reasoning, and interpreting things for yourself.\nI also combined git into this. Each blog will show the \u0026lsquo;diff\u0026rsquo; that it made to a doc, to show its significance. It will probably be useful to you.\n\u0026hellip;And who are you?\u003e \u0026hellip;And who are you? # I\u0026rsquo;d like to think I\u0026rsquo;m a story still being written. Check out my doc to find out who \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; currently am.\nHow did you build this?\u003e How did you build this? # I used Hugo with the help of the brilliant Blowfish theme. Here\u0026rsquo;s the source code of this website. Feel free to launch your own. I have the skills to create something like this, but there are more important things to build from the ground up.
