He explains how this is bullshit, basically. Of course, I agree.\nThe comments in particular are really insightful though. Mountains of people, both in the live chat in the video itself, and in the YouTube comments, seem to contend with the idea of \u0026lsquo;social anxiety\u0026rsquo;. The fact he even has to state \u0026ldquo;You have the power to create fun times, you\u0026rsquo;re just not doing it\u0026rdquo; is weird in of itself. If we had the power, why are we so reserved at using it? What is stopping us? I ask this as a devil\u0026rsquo;s advocate, because I have suffered from social anxiety previously.\nThe actual problem\u003e The actual problem # It\u0026rsquo;s just like the problem of procrastination all over again. Ultimately, it\u0026rsquo;s a dysregulation of dopamine that is the culprit, and when phrased in plain English it\u0026rsquo;s that, well, people, genuinely, don\u0026rsquo;t feel like an effort would lead to a reward.\nOf course this doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense. When we logically think it through, we can always rationalise how doing something will lead to something good. It\u0026rsquo;s something else that isn\u0026rsquo;t giving. The brain is a beautifully impressive engine and I won\u0026rsquo;t harshly criticise it, but, the facts are is that it feels this way for a complex set of reasons. My plain English understanding of this complex neurocircuity has come to a summit however. When rephrased: people, genuinely, don\u0026rsquo;t feel like they have enough control over the outcome. When this feeling of control is absent, known as locus of control in Psychology, people are unmotivated. And it\u0026rsquo;s easy to understand this: when we\u0026rsquo;re in flow, when we\u0026rsquo;re motivated, we feel in control enough to get something out of something. That\u0026rsquo;s why we keep going, we feel we\u0026rsquo;re on the right path, that trying is worth it. That is dopamine\u0026rsquo;s role in the brain.\nAmong other things, such as knowing there are no threats (other tasks that need doing), we can remain focused and get the job done, or near enough.\nRelation to social anxiety\u003e Relation to social anxiety # So how does this relate to social anxiety? People don\u0026rsquo;t feel like they have enough control over the complex outcomes of socialising, meaning they get overly anxious, and retreat. In reality, anxiety is ever-present. If you were to conversate with 100 people, the average person\u0026rsquo;s anxiety would probably be shooting through the roof. It\u0026rsquo;s natural. People with social anxiety shouldn\u0026rsquo;t feel like they are under-developed. The only thing you need to concern yourself with is building \u0026ldquo;control.\u0026rdquo;\nHow do you build control?\u003e How do you build control? # \u0026ldquo;1% improvements\u0026rdquo;. To quickly summarise the popular idea:\nThank you, James Clear. Oh, and habits. Yes, James is a very useful resource for this subject.\nSomething he doesn\u0026rsquo;t bang on about in his book Atomic Habits however is the importance of routine. As a person with anxiety and autism, and this is especially true for autistics, having a routine can sometimes be the only way you will ever do something. This is because you\u0026rsquo;re contending with your emotions the entire way, whilst mentally trying to process everything that is requiring doing and balancing what happens when, where, what and why. By having a routine, every single day becomes a foundation, where the next day becomes one where you know just how to improve upon it, and get to an even better day than the last. That becomes the only thing you have to focus on, and it\u0026rsquo;s direly liberating.\nThe Theory\u003e The Theory # This is what I refer to as \u0026ldquo;getting a feel\u0026rdquo;. Whenever something feels daunting in life, out of your control, or impossible, you just have to remind yourself that you just need to get a feel for it. After you get a feel, you know that you can keep trying and trying, and eventually you\u0026rsquo;ll get a grasp. And then eventually\u0026hellip;\n","date":"21 January 2023","permalink":"/underestimator/blogs/anxiety-success-control/","section":"Blogs","summary":"My understanding of how people gain skill and confidence\u003e My understanding of how people gain skill and confidence # Setting the scene\u003e Setting the scene # I was watching a video by Vaush ( https://www.","title":"Why Can't I Do Something?

You can replace that factor with just: \u0026ldquo;environment\u0026rdquo;. If the world does not have a channel of which people shall flow from it into your product, it just can\u0026rsquo;t happen. You can, as blanket advice, say \u0026ldquo;focus on things within your control\u0026rdquo;.\nThis is where the importance of a strategy comes in.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve constantly observed that having a strategy makes you resilient against bad luck and failure. It makes you ready for when the right moment inevitably comes. You know, so that you can think back and say, boy wasn\u0026rsquo;t I lucky back then? It\u0026rsquo;s not just nice to have a strategy, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial. And I blame media\u0026rsquo;s obsession with chess and megalomaniacal plans that people think strategies are something they can\u0026rsquo;t think up or execute on.\nReally, the most basic strategy (and basic NOT meaning bad at all) is focusing on improving your skill, above all else. Other strategic elements become clear as you know more about what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to do, and how you think you could succeed. Do you prioritise customers over immediate money, for instance. Do you focus on businesses, over regular people.\nTaking a step back. Notice how this then becomes decisions you\u0026rsquo;re making? You owe it to yourself, your future self - all selfs traversing through all multiverses - that you work on your skill and \u0026ldquo;ability to execute\u0026rdquo;, and ignore everything else. I have also heard people saying \u0026ldquo;do what makes you happy\u0026rdquo;. I think that is an excellent part of a strategy, and I think combining both that, and working on building skill, will lead you to a fulfilling, happy, lucky life.\nSo, no matter how risky that future looks, no matter how likely you are to fail, think about how you can gain a bit of control, and get more and more little by little until you become an overwhelming master that excites the cockles of fate, and brings joy into your life and everyone else\u0026rsquo;s.\n","date":"21 January 2023","permalink":"/underestimator/blogs/luck-or-failure-should-never-factor-your-decision/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Setting the scene\u003e Setting the scene # Watched a TED talk on the biggest factors why startups succeed.

Previous failures at launching a music recommendation startup at 18 years old have been demotivational, but my efforts were what caused me to be headhunted for Hatless. 2023 marks the beginning of a new chapter, as university has been completed, my time and energy are unshackled\u0026lt;sub\u0026gt;[[1]](/blogs/whoami/)\u0026lt;/sub\u0026gt;. + + I studied at the [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/). My undergraduate dissertation was a machine learning music recommendation SAAS web app that recommended familiar and novel music based on the mood someone\u0026#39;s looking for, and their emotional profile. It has a single source of truth integration with Spotify. It used reinforcement learning from user ratings to improve its music-emotion model. I\u0026rsquo;m Jordan, a 22 year old software engineer who is fresh out of university as of last year. I work as an Android Engineer at Realwear Inc.. It\u0026rsquo;s been an incredibly educational experience. But my whole journey leading up here has just been crazy. I\u0026rsquo;ve somehow been all over the shop, I mean, I started out in full stack development, not Android.\n\u0026hellip;Yeah, working on database models, all the way up to frontends that deal with plenty of user data, roles and permissions, and integrations with third-party APIs. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t just start off in one area apparently. But this was only because I needed to do it. I was passionate about one project: Emotion. A desktop app that integrated with Spotify and lets you rate how songs made you feel. This let you instantly create playlists for the mood you\u0026rsquo;re looking for. And of course, at first it didn\u0026rsquo;t need a database. But then I needed cloud synchronisation across my desktop and mobile devices. User analytics data for the upcoming beta test. etc. You get the picture.\nAnd there I went, in vanilla PHP I made a backend and a database in phpMyAdmin, with the little authentication knowledge I knew from Computer Science A Level. And it was exhilarating to see this all work. I felt just incredible.\n\u0026hellip;Before I released the beta and 95% of users stopped using it after 5 minutes. The remaining? After about 1 hour.\nTo say this put me off working on personal projects is an understatement, and it feels like much of the last 4 years of my life have been trying to coax blood out of stone, inspiring me to actually finish that project. And this site is a step in that direction. But I\u0026rsquo;m a little too harsh on myself. I created that desktop app in Windows Forms (a Windows exclusive technology\u0026hellip; yuck\u0026hellip;) when I was just 18 years old.\nBecause of that, I was headhunted by a group of students making a software contracting firm. I worked as a full stack developer and delivered some brilliant work at breakneck speed, and led projects which reversed death marches and found us with plenty of success.\nBut something else called for me. One of our clients asked me specifically to join their team, and I did. In Unity development. SimplyVideo had me developing VR meeting room software that integrated with Pexip. I accomplished that, and led another team and did more, which I can\u0026rsquo;t say under NDA because it unfortunately was never released. And it\u0026rsquo;s a shame because it is some seriously amazing integrations, that we will inevitably see in the future, it\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of time. It just won\u0026rsquo;t be me who does it.\nDue to conflict between cofounders, that startup collapsed. I soon found myself in the arms of a much bigger company, the largest company I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been in. RealWear. In Android.\nAnd I haven\u0026rsquo;t mentioned yet that my undergrad dissertation was a machine learning web app SAAS platform that was a massively improved Emotion? Using the skills I built in that contracting firm?\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s a bit ridiculous when I say it, but I\u0026rsquo;ve genuinely touched almost every area of software engineering, even going down (briefly) to the C++ layer for the purposes of WebRTC technologies.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t to say I don\u0026rsquo;t have a shit load to learn. I do. But it\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;m really proud about. However, these days, I care more about actually shipping something. It has been mostly out of my hands what the last 4 years have seen me accomplish, with the great overhead pressure of university constantly at my back. But 2023 is the first year where I have been unshackled, and now there\u0026rsquo;s no telling what could happen.\n","date":"21 January 2023","permalink":"/underestimator/blogs/whoami/","section":"Blogs","summary":"# /docs/jordan-peters-aka-rollersteaam + I\u0026#39;m a 22 year old software engineer who works for [Realwear Inc.](https://www.realwear.com/) as an Android Engineer\u0026lt;sub\u0026gt;[[1]](/blogs/whoami/)\u0026lt;/sub\u0026gt;, and I\u0026#39;m fanatically passionate about technology, software, creativity, UI/UX, design, productivity and psychology.","title":"whoami"},{"content":"Why does this exist?\u003e Why does this exist? # My thoughts needed a place that wasn\u0026rsquo;t locked inside my Notion.\nOther people have been braver than me and shared their thoughts bare for eyes to see, without any hubris.

Docs, the life blood of software, are a quick reference to learn a concept validated prior by engineers and their many works before it, where as a result you can immediately apply it. Blogs are the recorded paths, golden and muddy, to act as warning signs for other adventurers, and signs of hope.\nBlogs inform the docs. This website is designed around combining them both to lace the loose strands of knowledge together completely: a doc concisely explains the concept as objective as it can be explained. Blogs are every step to achieving that understanding. You will see references to blogs (hopefully) after most sentences in a doc, to explain how I\u0026rsquo;ve reached such a conclusion.\nThe result? I can construct a handbook of easily communicable skills that you can pick up. And you can also create jumps in your own understanding, likely above mine, by diving deeper into my blogs and reasoning, and interpreting things for yourself.\nI also combined git into this.
