A blog doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist to save the world or fix a grand problem. Especially not in one blog post. But it does inspire people, who eventually succeed at that.\nEvery fragment of information counts, and when you write, you convert the billions of bits of information you encounter every day into solid nodes that you can network and revelate into future actions.\nSo what is this place?\u003e So what is this place? # I came up with an idea.\nScientific papers are beautiful, but incredibly daunting to the layman. There is likely some academic snobbery and classism to explain that. But this beauty lies in its structure - they are actually designed for very concise reportings of progress, which is the exact opposite of your initial impression to them.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re a weird mixture of docs and blogs. Docs, the life blood of software, are a quick reference to learn a concept validated prior by engineers and their many works before it, where as a result you can immediately apply it. Blogs are the recorded paths, golden and muddy, to act as warning signs for other adventurers, and signs of hope.\nBlogs inform the docs. This website is designed around combining them both to lace the loose strands of knowledge together completely: a doc concisely explains the concept as objective as it can be explained. Blogs are every step to achieving that understanding. You will see references to blogs (hopefully) after most sentences in a doc, to explain how I\u0026rsquo;ve reached such a conclusion.\nThe result? I can construct a handbook of easily communicable skills that you can pick up. And you can also create jumps in your own understanding, likely above mine, by diving deeper into my blogs and reasoning, and interpreting things for yourself.\nI also combined git into this. Each blog will show the \u0026lsquo;diff\u0026rsquo; that it made to a doc, to show its significance. It will probably be useful to you.\n\u0026hellip;And who are you?\u003e \u0026hellip;And who are you? # I\u0026rsquo;d like to think I\u0026rsquo;m a story still being written. Check out my doc to find out who \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; currently am.\nHow did you build this?\u003e How did you build this? # I used Hugo with the help of the brilliant Blowfish theme. Here\u0026rsquo;s the source code of this website. Feel free to launch your own. I have the skills to create something like this, but there are more important things to build from the ground up. This is beautiful, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t one of them.\n","date":"21 January 2023","permalink":"/underestimator/about/","section":"Underestimator","summary":"Why does this exist?\u003e Why does this exist? # My thoughts needed a place that wasn\u0026rsquo;t locked inside my Notion.\nOther people have been braver than me and shared their thoughts bare for eyes to see, without any hubris.","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/underestimator/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/underestimator/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/underestimator/docs/","section":"Docs","summary":"","title":"Docs"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/underestimator/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/underestimator/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/underestimator/","section":"Underestimator","summary":"","title":"Underestimator"}]
