Docs are a full, but concise write-up of my understanding of a topic. They are a living document; they are updated overtime by each [blog](../blogs/).

<!-- Rules:
- Docs are made up of [blogs](/blogs/). A blog must first be created, causing a doc to be created.
- Docs may only be changed by creating a new blog post. With one exception: spelling and grammar errors are fixed silently. -->
