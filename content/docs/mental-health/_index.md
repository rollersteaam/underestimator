Mental health is complex. It seems that the brain can go through a state of mind, such as focused, energetic, lazy, bored, tired, or relaxed, and these states of mind govern the set of activities we are motivated to do. Through willpower and the knowledge of activities that succeed in doing so, it's possible to cause a state of mind transition to a desirable state, such as lazy and/or bored to focus and/or energetic, via the use of cold showers for example. This explains how exercise, meditation, and types of food, act as powerful aids for mental health.
