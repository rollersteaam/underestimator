I'm a 22 year old software engineer who works for [Realwear Inc.](https://www.realwear.com/) as an Android Engineer<sub>[[1]](/blogs/whoami/)</sub>, and I'm fanatically passionate about technology, software, creativity, UI/UX, design, productivity and psychology.

Previously Senior Unity Developer at SimplyVideo and Senior Full Stack Developer at Hatless Studios (student-led software contractor). As a result, I have very extensive experience with frontend, backend, game, and XR app development, and good experience with Android development<sub>[[1]](/blogs/whoami/)</sub>. Previous failures at launching a music recommendation startup at 18 years old have been demotivational, but my efforts were what caused me to be headhunted for Hatless. 2023 marks the beginning of a new chapter, as university has been completed, my time and energy are unshackled<sub>[[1]](/blogs/whoami/)</sub>.

I studied at the [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/). My undergraduate dissertation was a machine learning music recommendation SAAS web app that recommended familiar and novel music based on the mood someone's looking for, and their emotional profile. It has a single source of truth integration with Spotify. It used reinforcement learning from user ratings to improve its music-emotion model.
