I'm Jordan, a 22 year old software engineer who is fresh out of university as of last year. I work as an Android Engineer at [Realwear Inc.](https://www.realwear.com/) and it's been pretty crazy. I've somehow been all over the shop, as I actually started out in full stack development.

Yeah, that's right, working on database models, all the way to creating complicated frontends that deal with plenty of user data and integrations with third-party APIs. I couldn't just start off in one area. But this was only possible because I was passionate about one project: Emotion. A desktop app that integrated with Spotify and lets you rate how songs made you feel. This in turn, let you instantly create playlists for the mood you're looking for. And of course, at first it didn't need a database. But then I needed cloud synchronisation across my desktop and mobile devices. User analytics data for the upcoming beta test. etc. You get the picture.
 
And there I went, in vanilla PHP I made a backend and a database in phpMyAdmin, with the little authentication knowledge I knew from Computer Science A Level. And it was exhilirating to see this all work. I felt just incredible.

...Before I released the beta and 95% of users stopped using it after 5 minutes. The remaining? After about 1 hour.

To say this put me off working on personal projects is an understatement, and it feels like much of the last 4 years of my life have been trying to coax blood out of stone, inspiring me to actually finish that project. And this site is a step in that direction.

Because of that, I was headhunted by a group of students making a software contracting firm. I worked as a full stack developer and delivered some brilliant work at breakneck speed, and led projects which reversed death marches and found us with plenty of success.

But something else called for me. One of our clients asked me specifically to join their team, and I did. In Unity development. SimplyVideo had me developing VR meeting room software that integrated with Pexip. I accomplished that, and led another team and did more, which I can't say under NDA because it unfortunately was never released. And it's a shame because it is some seriously amazing integrations, that we will see in the future eventually. It's just a matter of time.

Due to conflict between cofounders, the startup collapsed. I soon found myself in the arms of a much bigger company, the largest company I've ever been in. RealWear. In Android.

And I haven't mentioned yet that my undergrad dissertation was a machine learning web app SAAS platform that was a massively improved Emotion? Using the knowledge I learned in that contracting firm?

So it's a bit ridiculous when I say it, but I've genuinely touched almost every area of software engineering, even going down (briefly) to the C++ layer for the purposes of WebRTC technologies.

This isn't to say I don't have a shit load to learn. I do. But it's something I'm really proud about. However, these days, I care more about actually shipping something. It has been mostly out of my hands what the last 4 years have seen me accomplish, with the great overhead pressure of university constantly at my back. But 2023 is the first year where I have been unshackled, and now there's no telling what could happen.
