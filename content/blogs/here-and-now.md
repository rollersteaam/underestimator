Here and now, and what comes after, are the two things that are really only worth working for. Achieving something, the feelings go away the day after. But every day? You feel the highs, and the lows, of actually doing the task itself. And so the task must be enjoyed, as what else is there really? Happiness once every few months? Get more out of your life. Seek more out of your every day.

And what is your identity? What reputation are you looking to build? Who are you looking to become?

These two things are why putting 110% into every day, from minute zero, are worth it.
