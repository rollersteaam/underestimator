## Setting the scene

Watched a TED talk on [the biggest factors why startups succeed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNpx7gpSqbY). Here are a few important comments:

![Team and execution is the key, causing improvements in timing, funding and business model](/luck-or-failure-should-never-factor-your-decision/comment1.png)

![Team cohesion and ability to stay on the same page, after years of pivoting, improvising and evolving, is something that often overlooked](/luck-or-failure-should-never-factor-your-decision/comment2.png)

## Luck and Failure

Yes, timing isn't within your control. You can replace that factor with just: "environment". If the world does not have a channel of which people shall flow from it into your product, it just can't happen. You can, as blanket advice, say "focus on things within your control".

This is where the importance of a strategy comes in.

I've constantly observed that having a strategy makes you resilient against bad luck and failure. It makes you ready for when the right moment inevitably comes. You know, so that you can think back and say, boy wasn't I lucky back then? It's not just nice to have a strategy, it's **crucial**. And I blame media's obsession with chess and megalomaniacal plans that people think strategies are something they can't think up or execute on.

Really, the most basic strategy (and basic NOT meaning bad at all) is focusing on improving your skill, above all else. Other strategic elements become clear as you know more about what you're trying to do, and how you think you could succeed. Do you prioritise customers over immediate money, for instance. Do you focus on businesses, over regular people.

Taking a step back. Notice how this then becomes decisions you're making? You owe it to yourself, your future self - all selfs traversing through all multiverses - that you work on your skill and "ability to execute", and ignore everything else. I have also heard people saying "do what makes you happy". I think that is an excellent part of a strategy, and I think combining both that, and working on building skill, will lead you to a fulfilling, happy, lucky life.

So, no matter how risky that future looks, no matter how likely you are to fail, think about [how you can gain a bit of control, and get more and more little by little](../anxiety-success-control) until you become an overwhelming master that excites the cockles of fate, and brings joy into your life and everyone else's.
