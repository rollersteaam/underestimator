Building projects is a non-linear process, just like success. It's not a question of "Is my idea any good?" or "Will my idea work?", because that idea *must* exist so that future ideas *can* exist. This means, your first idea is just as good (or perhaps, the more accurate word is **important**) as your final "idea." Therefore, your first idea should be treated with equal respect you would give to your "game-winning, millionaire" final idea.

Your first idea may be cannabalised beyond recognition once you reach the end, but it was still a component in your timeline. It is likely one component of 10+ ideas that resulted in your final idea. And the reality is, you need to overcome the "activation energy" of your first idea(s) to realize their potential, create entirely new ideas, new fundaments, and reach the end.

It's not a question of "if" that will happen. It is a question of how fast and how well you can evolve your first idea, which ultimately decides your fate as a startup. That's all there is. Create technologies that make you faster and better at making more technologies. Gain skills. Gain knowledge. Gain wisdom. Gain experience. Use all of these, and test data, to get closer and closer to what feels right, because your gut and the test results will lead you closer to that "truth".
