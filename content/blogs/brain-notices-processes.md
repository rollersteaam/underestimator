Discovered during meditation. What your brain notices, your brain processes. That means you can control your brains thoughts entirely by focusing on specific aspects. It could be the key to unlocking "infinite willpower". I realised this after I noticed how my brain destabilises from meditation consistently, it focuses on the breath. When it notices it succeeds, it spawns 3 other thoughts: my posture, the significance of this information, will I be able to keep it up? These in turn spawn uncertainty and disruption. Then I'm again distracted from the process. If you remove noticing it succeeding, I remain focused on the breath. By removing what you notice, you effectively control all brain's feelings.
