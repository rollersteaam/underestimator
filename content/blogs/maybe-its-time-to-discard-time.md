On our quest to be more productive, learning our patterns and figuring out how to optimise them, we continue to get hung up on one idea that pervades us the entire time. "Having time to do something." This is potentially one of the largest frictions you face on doing a chore, working on a side project, or back in the day when you were doing homework! Worrying if you have enough time to get X done, whether it's worth starting now, or not.

When it comes to planning work that could take several days, weeks, like a project, it's obvious that we need to think about time and let it affect our decision making. But I'm now advocating that for every other scenario, we should strive to ignore the concept of time itself. After all, it doesn't matter how long something takes, really all that matters is *what you actually get done*. You could take that a step further and even say that that's not really what matters, it's just how you spend your time that does. Building the skill, or building up a little momentum.

I consider this a mindfulness skill. Considering we all mostly strive for flow, this is a big step in doing that. Why distract ourselves with how much time we have remaining? Or whether we have enough time to do something? Why not just do it? Knowing and understanding time should only be something we do to serve us, but if it's ultimately getting in our way, we need to do away with it.

The next time you think that you don't have time to do something, or don't have enough time in your day, try just doing it and letting go. Life is meant to be lived, not measured.
