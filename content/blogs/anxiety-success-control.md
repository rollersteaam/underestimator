## My understanding of how people gain skill and confidence

### Setting the scene

I was watching a video by Vaush (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=804TeDKJ_dA) about how when people approach 30, or 18, or 21, or whatever, they panic like hell and believe their life is over. He explains how this is bullshit, basically. Of course, I agree.

The comments in particular are really insightful though. Mountains of people, both in the live chat in the video itself, and in the YouTube comments, seem to contend with the idea of 'social anxiety'. The fact he even has to state "You have the power to create fun times, you're just not doing it" is weird in of itself. If we had the power, why are we so reserved at using it? What is stopping us? I ask this as a devil's advocate, because I have suffered from social anxiety previously.

### The actual problem

It's just like the problem of procrastination all over again. Ultimately, it's a dysregulation of dopamine that is the culprit, and when phrased in plain English it's that, well, people, genuinely, *don't feel like an effort would lead to a reward*.

Of course this doesn't make any sense. When we logically think it through, we can always rationalise how doing something will lead to something good. It's something else that isn't giving. The brain is a beautifully impressive engine and I won't harshly criticise it, but, the facts are is that it feels this way for a complex set of reasons. My plain English understanding of this complex neurocircuity has come to a summit however. When rephrased: people, genuinely, *don't feel like they have **enough control** over the outcome*. When this feeling of control is absent, known as [locus of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control) in Psychology, people are unmotivated. And it's easy to understand this: when we're in flow, when we're motivated, we feel in control *enough* to get something out of something. That's why we keep going, we feel we're on the right path, that trying **is worth it**. That is dopamine's role in the brain.

Among other things, such as knowing there are no threats (other tasks that need doing), we can remain focused and get the job done, or near enough.

### Relation to social anxiety

So how does this relate to social anxiety? People don't feel like they have enough control over the complex *outcomes* of socialising, meaning they get overly anxious, and retreat. In reality, anxiety is ever-present. If you were to conversate with 100 people, the average person's anxiety would probably be shooting through the roof. It's natural. People with social anxiety shouldn't feel like they are under-developed. The only thing you need to concern yourself with is building "control."

### How do you build control?

"1% improvements". To quickly summarise [the popular idea](https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries/the-compound-effect):

Thank you, [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement). Oh, and [habits](https://jamesclear.com/). Yes, James is a very useful resource for this subject.

Something he doesn't bang on about in his book Atomic Habits however is the importance of routine. As a person with anxiety and autism, and this is *especially* true for autistics, having a routine can sometimes be the **only way** you will **ever** do something. This is because you're contending with your emotions the entire way, whilst mentally trying to process everything that is requiring doing and balancing what happens when, where, what and why. By having a routine, every single day becomes a foundation, where the next day becomes one where you know just how to improve upon it, and get to an even better day than the last. That becomes the only thing you have to focus on, and it's direly liberating.

## The Theory

This is what I refer to as "getting a feel". Whenever something feels daunting in life, out of your control, or impossible, you just have to remind yourself that you *just* need to get a feel for it. After you get a feel, you know that you can keep trying and trying, and eventually you'll get a grasp. And then eventually...
