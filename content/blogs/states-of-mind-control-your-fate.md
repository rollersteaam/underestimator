# /docs/mental-health
+ Mental health is complex. It seems that the brain can go through a state of mind, such as focused, energetic, lazy, bored, tired, or relaxed, and these states of mind govern the set of activities we are motivated to do. Through willpower and the knowledge of activities that succeed in doing so, it's possible to cause a state of mind transition to a desirable state, such as lazy and/or bored to focus and/or energetic, via the use of cold showers for example. This explains how exercise, meditation, and types of food, act as powerful aids for mental health.

# /docs/luck
+ Activity seems to generate luck compared to inactivity. Even though inactivity can sometimes be attributed to luck, it's often past activity that had generated future luck, which inactivity had enabled its completion. Active states of mind, likely by one's choice to enter into, generate activity and therefore create luck.
+
+ This has wide implications, such as on the idea of "skill" and its effect on success. One may linearly view one person as being better than another at a specific activity, but the truth is is that the environment one is in could place such a loser over another, reliably, and with great difference in ability. This then runs contrary to the importance of measuring IQ or general factor in intelligence. Whatever potential someone has, even if measured in an abstract test, cannot be put to use in practical circumstances if there is a toxic work environment, unstable home and social life, unstable mental health, or deeply ingrained beliefs of being inadequate. Given the many confounds, one of the only conclusions I can come to is that the only thing worth worrying about when it comes to whether you will succeed or not is if you are doing something that you care about. If you care about it, and I suppose by extension you are feeling a reward from it, it's irrelevant whether you succeed or do not succeed, just that you persist and seek out constant changes in work and your environment which could help you do a little better, day by day. This bet against fate is surely a winning bet overtime due to the 1% rule, and the typical successful outcomes that occur when strategy is involved.

+ It seems that the brain can go through a state of mind, such as focused, energetic, lazy, bored, tired, or relaxed, and these states of mind govern the set of activities we are motivated to do.

# /docs/skill
+ Skill is strange. Its relationship to potential fluctuates. For example, states of mind govern the set of actions we're motivated to do, but these states of mind also magnify how tenacious we are, and how much mental clarity we have. Skill then must have a wide scope upon which it applies to individuals, as there is a reliance on general "health" skills that assist in turning the mind and body into a powerful tool, and specific "activity" skills relevant to the ability there itself. And those specific skills cannot be found or used without the necessary states of mind.

+ This is problematic because one may linearly view one person as being better than another at a specific activity, but the truth is is that the environment one is in could place such a loser over another, reliably, and with great difference in ability.

Stimulants and activities change the chemical state of our mind and body, which in turn cause a state of mind transition. This state of mind has a governing set of activities which we are motivated to do, and so we often end up doing them unless under alternative circumstances.

So, when you're drinking a coffee, you're altering your state of mind into something new. That doesn't mean it turns on your productivity, nor that it increases productivity necessarily, even by a significant amount, but that it enables new actions that previously your body wouldn't be able to do.

Meditation is another example, so is exercise, and so are cold showers. The same can be said of eating food and sleeping. Whilst eating food and sleeping might be associated slightly negatively with good outcomes, at least, when in excess, they are vital to our longevity because they are forms of rest. Rest is a necessity, so if you're overclocking into a state of mind of "action" for too long and you neglect your rest, your body will pay you back with illness and probably difficulty socialising with people.
