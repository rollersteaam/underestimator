Blogs are what you expect; they're writings and thoughts about a topic.

<!-- Rules:
- A blog must always change a [doc](/docs/); creating a new doc, or adding and removing from them.
- The changes will be stated.
- They are treated like ["git commits"](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit#:~:text=Commits%20are%20the%20core%20building,at%20that%20point%20in%20time.), once posted their content is **never changed.** With one exception: if there are typos or grammar errors, they will be done silently. -->
