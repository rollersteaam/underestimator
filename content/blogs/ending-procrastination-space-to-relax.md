Tips and tricks on how to be productive rank endlessly on Instagram posts and YouTube videos bound to recommendation feeds. They're all trying to solve the same problem: procrastination.

How do we end procrastination? Some astute people have mentioned that it's just us being fearful of what we need to do. I have talked about how it's a [lack of control](./anxiety-success-control.md) over successful outcomes that causes us to do something else. Procrastination is some action to alleviate short term rises in stress, to make whatever is ahead of us easier, simpler to handle. At least, that's what our System 1 brain (instinct brain) thinks. It succeeds in its goal to minimise stress, but in the long term it's increasing it.

Of course, this isn't really helping us solve what's ahead. Because the real problem *is* that lack of control. But let me make this clear. It's our perception of the task itself that is the problem. In today's world, which is rife with easy to access distractions, we are constantly contending with work that requires a lot of effort to put into our brain's active memory. It's hard, complicated work, being a student, writer, engineer, designer, etc. it's all knowledge work, we have to put in the whole context of the problem to do a good enough job at it. As we get more skilled at our jobs, we can more easily overcome this effort barrier. Our legs get taller. However, this often means we face bigger and bigger challenges.

Point being, this is something that everyone deals with, at every stage of life. We also have brains that work in a whole bunch of different ways that seem to justify having 50 strategies of dealing with "procrastination".

However, what's common between these strategies are two things, that actually help us get to where want to be. Firstly, most strategies involve breaking down the task in some method to make it easier to perform. So, the first principle (Clarity) is making the task more clear and understandable. And secondly, they involve alleviating stress somehow. So the second principle (Energy) is managing emotions and energy. It seems procrastination is solved if you "solve these 2 problems".

Solving clarity includes scheduling as a tool as well, after all, to timebox it and commit to it within a time block requires a general understanding of its time limitations, among other time requirements on your calendar.

A lot of people mention "eat the frog". Or "start small". Task prioritisation. Doing a task where you "have the most energy in the day". I'm a bit suspicious on the nature of this advice, because a lot of the body is predictable and controllable for the most part. I have a feeling we do things, on habit, which set up the conditions for these tips and tricks to be effective. Which also means that we can just adjust the habits to setup the perfect scenario every time, in other words, [optimise our time to be more efficient](what-being-a-founder-and-hustle-culture-really-mean.md).

To solve these two principles, and assist in setting up this environment, I want to combine the ideas of "being bored", relaxation, meditation, and... rubberduckying.

That's the thing, I don't doubt that millionaires are masters of using certain techniques to will themselves into action - maybe they do certain things unconsciously - but almost universally every entrepreneur is 'solving problems'. In companies, regularly scheduled and blocked packed days, and so on, the need to 'self-motivate' is not an issue. Why? Because our System 1 brain is essentially being thrown into the deep end, to 'sink or swim'. And swim it will, because it's great for pulling us out of shit (ever done a 24 hour allnighter using energy you never thought you had?). The above are hardly dire circumstances however, some people would probably argue they're *ideal* circumstances. But how do we replicate it this in our home offices and solo startups?

The space to be... bored. And no, I'm not talking about "dopamine detoxing". I think it's mostly bullshit. However, I have stolen an idea from the dopamine detox. I'm advocating for the idea of leaning back in your office chair, right now, and staring up into the sky. Doing... practically nothing. Well, except for thinking through what you're about to do next. And I mean, in detail. How can we dissect the problem? What are the likely solutions we need to figure out? What am I actually trying to write here? What is the point I'm trying to get to? Where do I need to go read next? Why do I need to go read that next?

All of these questions, as you roam the paths of your mind, recall memories and unpick things until the problem almost certainly occupy your mind entirely, assuming you didn't get too distracted (and even then distractions have their limit here).

Because you're sitting in your chair relaxing, activating your brain and actually engaging, motivation, energy, creativity, all of that galvanic juice starts flowing. Sooner or later, whatever problems you were facing preventing you from easily engaging with the task should be ripe for the taking.
